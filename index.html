            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Darsh, a student who enjoys building creative projects and sharing what I learn. I get excited when I can connect classroom ideas to real-life experiments that make people smile. During study sessions I keep a notebook of new questions, because curiosity keeps me focused. Exploring technology challenges me to think bigger and push past what I believed possible. This website is a small peek into the topics that inspire me every single day.</p>
            <p>Outside of school, I spend time with friends and family who support my goals and creativity. We swap stories about our weeks, and those conversations motivate me to build meaningful habits. I like setting mini challenges for myself so that progress feels consistent and rewarding. When I finish a project, I always reflect on what I learned and how I can improve next time. That reflective mindset helps me stay grounded while dreaming about the future.</p>
