            <h2>Dreams in Motion</h2>
            <p>My biggest goal is to study computer science and design tools that help students learn faster. I picture classrooms where interactive lessons respond to each student's curiosity. To get there, I am strengthening my math foundations and improving my problem-solving mindset. I am also practicing communication so I can explain complex ideas to different audiences. These habits build confidence that I can lead projects that make a positive impact.</p>
            <p>Another dream is to travel and collaborate with teams from different cultures. Hearing diverse perspectives will push me to consider solutions I might overlook alone. I plan to document each experience through videos and blogs that inspire younger students. Along the way, I want to mentor peers who are just beginning their tech journeys. Guiding others keeps me focused on gratitude while I reach for the future I imagine.</p>
