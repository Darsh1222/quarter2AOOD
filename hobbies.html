            <h2>Creating and Playing</h2>
            <p>Creative coding projects keep me exploring new ideas during quiet evenings. I experiment with small apps that blend storytelling and interactivity for friends. When a new concept clicks, I jot it down immediately so I can build it later. Debugging challenges me to stay patient and celebrate each tiny breakthrough. These projects remind me that learning can be playful when I guide the experience myself.</p>
            <p>I also love playing pickup basketball at the neighborhood park after class. The rhythm of passing and communicating teaches me how teamwork leads to momentum. Win or lose, we all share tips that make the next game smarter and more fun. Running the court clears my mind and helps me return to homework with fresh energy. Balancing sports and coding keeps me active while feeding both mind and body.</p>
